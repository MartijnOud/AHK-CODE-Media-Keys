# AHK CODE Mediakeys
[AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/) script to mimic the media keys of the [CODE keyboard](https://codekeyboards.com/).

I love the way the CODE keyboard does _media keys_ and wanted to mimic it on my home setup.

## Key rebinds
- `Appskey` is the menu key right next to the right `Ctrl` key

|                  |     Media    |
|:----------------:|:------------:|
| Menu + Insert    | Play / Pause |
| Menu + Home      | Stop         |
| Menu + Page Up   | Volume Up    |
| Menu + Delete    | Previous     |
| Menu + End       | Next         |
| Menu + Page Down | Volume Down  |
| Menu + Pause     | Volume Mute  |

## Instructions
1. Install [AutoHotkey](https://autohotkey.com/)
2. Down the `.ahk` file and run it
3. Test your media keys
	- Depending on your keyboard you might need to remap `Appskey` to `RAlt` or `AltGr`
4. (optionally) Place the `.ahk` file in your _Startup_ folder
